## The Goal
We’re going to build a Flask app using the Spoonacular API. Your app should take in the user’s preference for what type of recipes they are interested in and return a list of recipes based on their request. 


### Possible App Ideas: 
While exploring the Spoonacular documentation you will realize that there are hundreds of thousands of recipes that you can filter through. You can search and filter through these recipes by query, and/or by ingredients, and/or by nutrients, giving you many different options for building this app. Here are some possible app ideas that you can create using the Spoonacular API: 

#### Option 1: The Ain’t No Body Got Time for Cooking App
Create an app that allows users to find recipes based on their food preference and set a limit for how long it should take to prepare and cook the recipe in their search 

#### Option 2: Diet Specific App
Create a diet preference app that takes the users query for food and allows them to select from recipes that fall under a particular diet, ex: vegetarian, gluten-free, paleo

#### Option 3: Nutrient-Based App
Create an app that allows users to find recipes based on the limits they set for macronutrients (calories, proteins, fats, and carbs) and/or micronutrients

#### *You are not limited to these ideas. Feel free to combine any of the queries above to create a more dynamic app or come up with your own app idea if you wish to be more creative and so something else.*

#### IMPORTANT NOTE:  there are dozens of available endpoints so be sure to read through all the different options carefully in order to select the one most most suitable for your app!
